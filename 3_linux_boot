1) Kernel Loading
-----------------

The stage 2 bootloader contiunously switch protected-real mode to load by
pieces the image of the kernel in addresses not reachable in real mode.
It uses always the mapped BIOS facilities.

The first routine of Linux called is start_of_setup() (in real mode).
This setup a stack, write 0 in BSS and then jumps to main().

main loads the IDT address in IDTR. In real mode it was at address 0. 
It then call setup_gdt() and jump to protected mode without paging.

Now higher addresses are accessible and the kernel image is decompressed.

Until now the Kernel replaced pieces of bootloader. Now the kernel or the
bootloader calls the first uncompressed routing: startup_32().

This routine determinates the actual prosition with a call/pop and call a
second startup_32 function that build IDT, GDT and enables paging.

Now it is the time to the architecture independent entry point: start_kernel().

2) Early Paging
---------------

In details, before the setup of an useful page table the early setup is to load
an hardcoded small page tables with only two entries that covers code, data and
a bit of free buffers (8 MB). The variable is called swapped_pg_dir.
PAGE OFFSET is used, a very minimalistic virtual to physical mapping
(in 32 bit it adds 3 gb because in physical memory kernel starts at 0 and in
virtual memory it starts at 3 gb).

Now a more complex paging architecture must be setupped. The free biffers can
be used to construct a new page table.

The memory map of the kernel is known at linking time. A small mamroy manager,
bootmem, is embedded at linking time an contains a bitmap that tells what 4kb
frames are free (not in code or data). This bitmap can be also modified to
get memory but only during this boot stage.

The kernel will manage different classes of page tables.
Each arch define macros that are combination of bits.

In setup_arch() -> paging_init() ... the kernel allocate a new page table with
chunks of 4 KB.

In x86 the layout is:

Page General Directory -> Page Middle Directory -> Page Table

Without PAE PMD has only one entry.

We are filling a page table with paging enables sfo irst of all we populate the
low levevel page table.
We must ensure that the entry in swapped_pg_dir must point to the same 4kb page
in the low entry.

This is not a real issue because the old page table is cahced in TLB and so,
in the end, the TLB is flushed.

Now the kernel goes to cpu_idle() waiting for interrupts/rescheduling.

Note: the best tlb invalidation code for the arch must be selcted cause it can
be costly.
flush_tlb_all synchrinize all cores flush all with an high cost.
flush_tlb_mm takes an mm struct used to describe an address space of a process.
flush_tlb_page with only a specified page to be invalidated.
There is also flush_tlb_range, useful when implementing mremap or mprotect.

3) Flow
-------

PID 0 start_kernel() -> rest_init() ---------> cpu_idle()
                            |
                            v
                     New kernel thread:
                       kernel_init() -> schedule() [before cpu_idle]

/sbin/init started in kernel_init thread. Several subsystems like VFS, devices
management and interrupts must be initialized before calling init.

/sbin/init is in the ramdisk.

4) Init
-------

Init is KISS and spawn several services to do jobs like mount drives and network
setup.

Runlevels:

 - 1 (S) single user
 - 2 multiuser (no networking)
 - 3 full multiuser
 - 4 unused
 - 5 X11
 - 6 reboot
 - 0 halt

Scripts placed in /etc/init.d/
In /etc/rc.d/rc#.d/ there are symlinks to init.d scripts ad custom scripts.
S## start scripts, K## stop scripts.

service <scriptname> <action>

/etc/inittab format: id:runevel:action:process

Systemd is based on the notion of "units" and "dependencies". Scripts are not
in shell language. Runlevels are called targets.

To change runlevel in System V Initi call init 1, in systemd change a symlink
to the desired target.

In systemd targets we have several section. Unit is a section with dependencies
both positive and negative on other units. Service section describe what you
want to do. Install section tells when the unit must be started.

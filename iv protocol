the problem is with temporal locality. loading and unloading two bytes that needs the same cache lines.

good: the protocol require only a bit (I or V).

moesi stable states.

write-trougth caches any time exchanging with other lev cache the data must propagate immediately.
write back propaga quando quando c'Ã¨ evict esplicita.

false cache sharing must be avoided from the operating system in the memory management.
solution: move data to another ram location.

phys addr: divided in frames.
a page can be mapped to the same frmae of another.

shmem: vistual aliasing. map to the same cache location or flush.

program order: total order of mem ops 
consostency enforcing combining memory order and program oerder.

sequeantial consincesty is not implemented

 ** Shitty notes of the Advanced Operating Systems and Virtualization course at
    Sapienza University of Rome in shitty text files **

    Written with <3 by Andrea Fioraldi <andreafioraldi@gmail.com>

The material si divided in chapters and each chapter, in general, covers
multiple related topics.

Some topics that are for me obvious like the structure of GOT and PLT in the
ELF are omitted, these notes are not a replacement of the course material.

Table of contents:

  1. An introduction to x86
  2. The x86 boot process
  3. The Linux specific boot process
  4. Memory management
  5. System calls
  6. Loadable modules
  7. Interrupts and time
  8. Concurrency
  9. Virtual File System and Devices
 10. Processes
 11. Scheduling
 12. Virtualization and Containers
